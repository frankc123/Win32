This is a series of batch files that will install Ubuntu onto the TF101. All kernel builds and Ubuntu filesystems were used from lilstevie's post on Ubuntu on the tf ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1191141 ).

I am working on a GUI version but is on standby until i can get the basic batch files to install properly. If you find any problem with my files please let me know.

Under Pictures you will find screen shots of the latest gui. I will not release the gui until it works properly. Also if anyone has experience in coding VB let me know. I could use a hand.

But thanks everyone who has put into this project in hole. Everyone that contributed to lil stevies thread along with every tool that is used.
